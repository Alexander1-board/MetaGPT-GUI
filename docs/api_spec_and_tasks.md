## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Main entry point of the application. Initializes GradioInterface and MetaGPT. Handles the flow of getting input, generating text, and displaying output."),
    ("gpt_model.py", "Implements the MetaGPT class. Responsible for loading the model and generating text."),
    ("gui.py", "Implements the GradioInterface class. Responsible for creating the GUI and handling user interactions."),
    ("utils.py", "Contains utility functions that may be used across different modules.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "utils.py",
    "gpt_model.py",
    "gui.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'utils.py' contains utility functions that may be used across different modules. For example, it may contain a function for handling exceptions during model loading or text generation.

'gpt_model.py' should contain the MetaGPT class. This class should have a method 'generate_text' that takes a string as input and returns a string as output. The input string is the prompt for the GPT model and the output string is the generated text.

'gui.py' should contain the GradioInterface class. This class should have methods for creating the GUI and displaying output. The GUI should have a text input field for the user to enter the prompt and a text display area to show the generated text.

'main.py' is the main entry point of the application. It should initialize GradioInterface and MetaGPT, and handle the flow of getting input, generating text, and displaying output.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me. We need to start by implementing the utility functions in 'utils.py', then move on to 'gpt_model.py' and 'gui.py', and finally integrate everything in 'main.py'.
